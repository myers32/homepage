## *Who made this project?*

This project is made by ✨myself.✨ 
It is made for the training purposes, I am student at online coding school [YouCode](https://www.youcode.pl).

## *What can I find in this project?

You can find some information related to the world's best airlines and ranking made by *Passenger Choice Skytrax*. 
There is an article written where you also can find some vital factors which were taken under consideration during establishing the ranking.

This project includes 5 sections: 
1. Main page.
2. Ranking winner section.
3. Top 5 airlines in the world - ranking by *Passenger Choice Skytrax*.
4. Table with airlines in order - from first place to fifth. That table also includes a number of owned aircrafts and routes and supported routes.
5. Related links. Links that includes:
- Top 100 airlines ranking.
- Best Airline Cabin Crew.
- World's most improved airlines. 

## *Which programming languages did you use?*

During creation I used mostly html - HyperText Markup Language. More or less 70%-75% of the code is made in html. But you can also find **very** simple JavaScript.
CSS is present too, to put some styling and make it better for the eye. I hope that it is good for the eye! At least not painful :P
